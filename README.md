# Tweetit
A twitter bot inspired from [twitter-bot-bootstrap
](https://github.com/spences10/twitter-bot-bootstrap) 

The stock version of the code only had retweet feature working. This particular version has ability to retweet, like, reply, follow and tweeting quotes. It is been used live in my twitter handle: [chaitanyagiri](http://twitter.com/chaitanyagiri)

There is one more major difference in it. I HATE CONSOLE.LOL(); So I have replaced it. XD
